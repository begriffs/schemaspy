<h3><a href='http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net'>SchemaSpy</a> Database Types</h3>

One goal of SchemaSpy is to support a wide range of JDBC-complaint databases.  
It uses the concept of "database types", as specified by .properties files, to
achieve that goal.  
Out of the box SchemaSpy supports a multitude of databases.  
If your database isn't currently supported or needs to be customized then continue reading.

<p>For SchemaSpy to support your database it must:
<ol>
    <li>Have JDBC drivers available</li>
    <li>The JDBC drivers must provide JDBC metadata</li>
</ol>

The vast majority of relational databases have JDBC drivers that provide appropriate metadata.

<h4>Database Type .properties Files</h4>
<p>The -t command-line parameter specified which type of database you're dealing with.
For example: <code>-t mysql</code> says to use the MySQL-specific database type file
named <code>mysql.properties</code>.  
This file, by default, lives in the SchemaSpy jar file, but if you specify a path to the
file then it can also reside on your file system so you can easily modify / experiment
with the file's settings.

<p>Let's start with a simple (and typical) database type file called <code>mysql.properties</code>.
The basic file looks like this:
<pre>
  description=MySQL

  driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

  connectionSpec=jdbc:mysql://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;db&gt;
  host=hostname[:port] host where database resides with optional port
  db=database name
</pre>

<h4>Basic entries</h4>
<div class='entry'>description</div>
 <div class='def'>
   Simple description of the type of database.
 </div>
<div class='entry'>driver</div>
 <div class='def'>
  The full name of the driver class that provides the required JDBC services.
  This class name is provided by the database driver vendor.
 </div>
<div class='entry'>connectionSpec</div>
 <div class='def'>
  The format of the connection spec is defined by the database driver vendor.
  It usually has a format similar to the one used for MySQL: <code>jdbc:mysql://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;db&gt;</code>
  <br>The names surrounded by &lt; and &gt; are required by the driver vendor
  and will become required parameters on the SchemaSpy command line.
  Those command line values will be substituted into the connection spec
  before it is used to connect to the database.  
 </div>
<div class='entry'>host and db</div>
 <div class='def'>
  These will vary for each type of database and provide documentation for the 
  names surrounded by &lt; and &gt; in <code>connectionSpec</code>.
  For example, if you forget to specify -host on the command line then you will
  get an error message that includes the text:
   <p><code>hostname[:port] host where database resides with optional port</code>
  <p>The idea is to have meaningful error messages / descriptions of these 
  database-specific parameters.
 </div>

<h4>Custom SQL</h4>
The remaining entries in the .properties file are <b>not required</b> for most databases.
They're typically used to provide functionality that either isn't provided by the 
JDBC metadata services or when those services are in some way inappropriate 
(performance, incorrect results, etc.).

<p>For these SQL-based entries you can use optional "named parameters" in the SQL.  
These named parameters are 
<code>:schema</code>, <code>:owner</code>, <code>:table</code> and <code>:view</code>.  
They will be substituted with appropriate values at runtime.

 <tr>
  <td>selectViewSql</td>
  <td>text</td>
  <td>Details of a specific view, usually the SQL used to create the view.</td>
  <td>Single view</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>selectTableIdsSql</td>
  <td>table_id, table_name</td>
  <td>Unique ID for each table.  
  This is useful for databases (such as DB2) that may give error messages with just 
  table IDs instead of names.</td>
  <td>Database</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>selectIndexIdsSql</td>
  <td>index_id, index_name, table_name</td>
  <td>Unique ID for each table index.

  index IDs instead of names.</td>
  <td>Database</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h4>Reusing Configurations</h4>
For those instances where you have two almost identical configurations you can
use the <code>extends</code> entry, specifying another .properties file to be "extended."
Interaction with DB2 through its "type 4 network driver", for example, is almost identical
to the the DB2 "app driver".  
<code>db2net.properties</code> therefore has a line that reads 
<code>extends=db2</code> and only includes those configuration options that 
deviate from <code>db2.properties</code>.

<h4>Single-Threaded Drivers</h4>
There's one remaining database configuration entry named <code>dbThreads</code>.
It is used for database drivers whose metadata queries aren't thread safe.
If your driver returns failures like "stream already closed" then you'll need 
to specify either <code>dbThreads=1</code> in your .properties or "-dbThreads 1" 
on the command line.
