# connection spec
#  text between <>'s will be prompted for on the command line
#    e.g. if <host> is in connectionSpec then you must have -host on the command line
#  if you're missing a required parameter then you're be prompted with the text
#  that's associated with that paramter
#    e.g. missing -db then you'll be prompted for 'database name'
# expected format: jdbc:mysql://[hostname][:port]/dbname
connectionSpec=jdbc:mysql://<host>/<db>
host=hostname[:port] (possibly just localhost)
db=database name

driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

# point this to whatever is appropriate on your machine...let me know if there's a standard path/jar
# you can use the -cp command line option if you prefer
# The driver should be available at www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/
driverPath=/mysql/mysql-connector-java-3.1.12-bin.jar

# if your driver returns failures like "stream already closed" then its metadata
# services probably aren't thread safe and you'll have to uncomment this line
# or specify "-dbThreads 1" on the command line.

# the following SQL is optional
# fill it in if you want to see the SQL used to create your views or your check constraints
# send it back to schemaspy.sourceforge.net if it works
# these named parameters are supported: :schema, :owner, :table and :view

# return text that represents a specific :view / :schema
#selectViewSql=

# return table_name, constraint_name and text for a specific :schema
#selectCheckConstraintsSql=

# return table_name, comments for a specific :schema (which MySQL doesn't have, so the db name will be used)
# useful if db driver doesn't return this info

# return table_name, column_name, comments for a specific :schema
