# connection spec
#  text between <>'s will be prompted for on the command line
#    e.g. if <host> is in connectionSpec then you must have -host on the command line
#  if you're missing a required parameter then you're be prompted with the text
#  that's associated with that paramter
#    e.g. missing -db then you'll be prompted for 'database name'
# expected format: jdbc:firebirdsql://[hostname][:port]/dbname
connectionSpec=jdbc:firebirdsql://<host>/<db>
host=hostname[:port] (possibly just localhost)
db=database name

# if your driver returns failures like "stream already closed" then its metadata
# services probably aren't thread safe and you'll have to uncomment this line
# or specify "-dbThreads 1" on the command line.
