    <li>You can now specify a subset of tables/views to include in the analysis
        with the new -i &lt;regularExpression&gt; option.</li>
    <li>Now supports Firebird.</li>
    <li>Now supports Microsoft SQL Server 2005 thanks to Craig Boland
        providing a configured mssql05.properties file.</li>
    <li>Now supports Informix thanks to Tom Conlin
        providing a configured informix.properties file.</li>
    <li>A new option (-maxdet) was added to help keep extremely large
        schemas from getting out of control.</li>
    <li>Some users needed to specify the character set used to connect to their
        database, so a new option (-connprops) was added.</li>
    <li>The relationships page will now always be available, even if there are no relationships or just
        implied relationships.</li>
    <li>Tables that contain only implied relationships will now show them by default.</li>
    <li>Resolution of <a
        href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1440650&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug

        request 1445745</a>) and reserved words (<a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1449203&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug
        1449203</a>).</li>
    <li>Resolution of <a
        href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=1481396&group_id=137197">bug
        1481396</a> - NumberFormatException in view.DotFormatter.writeHeader.  Now includes
        diagnostics to help identify Graphviz configuration issues.</li>
    <li>Cleaned-up the formatting of table details.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.2 - 02/28/2006
<ul>
<li>Now generates a relatively useful relationships page even if dot fails 
	to build the larger (and more likely to break Graphviz's dot) images.</li>
<li>Lots of minor code cleanup after cranking up Eclipse's warning levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.1 - 02/05/2006
<ul>
<li>Added a more descriptive error message when the correct version of 
    Graphviz dot isn't installed.</li>
<li>Some people were having problems by passing -cp to java and not to SchemaSpy.  
    The classpath-related error messages now clearly specify where -cp belongs.</li>
<li>Revamped the classpath-related error messages to include the classpath 
    entries that weren't valid.  This should make it easier to track down JDBC 
    driver issues.</li>
<li>Updated MySQL's configuration file to point to the latest JDBC drivers.  
    Also gave the URL for the Connector/J drivers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.0 - 11/23/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy can now analyze all of the schemas of a database with one command.
    This feature should allow a DBA to do a bulk analysis, documenting every user 
    schema with one command.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1350392&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1350392</a>
    - NullPointer if FK table not in analyzed schema.</li>
<li>Was missing the border along the top edge of the page.</li>
<li>Luke Hutteman found a threading issue while reviewing portions of the code.  
    Thanks Luke!</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1351460&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1351460</a>
    - Tab background color mis-named.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1351488&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1351488</a>
    - Relationships tab displayed when no relationships exist.</li>
<li>The layout of the tab area is now significantly cleaner.</li>
<li>Added -rankdirbug option to deal with the dot bugs that invariably result from 
    using a non-standard rankdir in .dot files.  
    This option should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Refactored many of the 'formatters' to become 'pages'.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.0.0 - 11/06/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy now uses a tabbed layout that results in a significantly cleaner page.</li>
<li>You now have the ability to explicitly exclude columns from the relationship 
    analysis using a regular expression notation.  
    This keeps those pesky tables that are related to everything from severely 
    cluttering your view of your schema.</li>
<li>Added information in the graphs about how many 'parent' and 'child' tables are 
    related to a given table.  
    This gives a visual clue that there are more tables beyond the outskirts of 
    what's currently visible.</li>
<li>SchemaSpy now supports HSQLDB thanks to bension providing a hsqldb.properties 
    configuration file.</li>
<li>Added support for DB2 UDB Type 4 driver.</li>
<li>The graphs are now clearer due to the use of a sans serif font.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1340880&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1340880</a>
    - accent characters cause dot to fail.  
    SchemaSpy now generates the .dot files using the UTF-8 character set, which 
    is what the dot program expects.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.7.1 - 10/20/2005
<ul>
<li>Added support for DB2's Net (Type 4) driver.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1325650&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1325650</a>.
    Was having more problems with extracting information on Oracle indexes.  
    Due to an Oracle driver bug (Oracle bug #2686037) I inverted how the 
    selectIndexesSql gets evaluated and significantly optimized the SQL.  
    Thanks to Andrea for helping to figure all of this out.</li>
<li>Added details of the -cp option to the diagnostic messages when unable to 
    load database drivers.</li>
<li>Fixed some minor cosmetic problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.7.0 - 10/11/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy now supports PostgreSQL thanks to Tomi Ollila providing a 
    pgsql.properties.</li>
<li>Added a new page that lists all of the columns (with details) in the schema.  
    The intent of this page is to make it easier to find inconsistencies in the 
    schema as well as make it easier to do things like search for all instances 
    of a certain type of column (e.g. 'timestamp').</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1283622&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1283622</a>.
    A user from the Slovak Republic ran into problems where dot was unable to 
    deal with some of the characters that are in this character set.  
    Now it should handle them appropriately.</li>
<li>Refactored how the links on each page get generated.  
    It was pretty much cut and paste before.  
    Now it's consolidated in HtmlFormatter.writeTableOfContents() so it's much 
    more consistent and easier to change.</li>
<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1312220&group_id=137197&atid=737990">feature request 1312220</a>:
    Modified build.xml to include an appropriate level of debug information 
    (source files and line numbers).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.6.1 - 09/16/2005
<ul>
<li>Fixed Utilities page to not have the 'Generated by SchemaSpy' label on each 
    table.</li>
<li>Yan-Fa Li figured out what was causing dot problems on Unix: quotes around 
    filenames.</li>
<li>Updated the legend to somewhat match the new IE diagram representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.6.0 - 09/11/2005 
<ul>
<li>Now displays graphical relationships using Information Engineering (IE) notation.
    This should make it easier to understand the different types of relationships 
    in the schema.</li>
<li>Beefed-up the code that detects if dot is being executed correctly.
    Some users were getting output that implied that dot was working, but no images 
    were created.</li>
<li>Added version information to .dot files to help debugging.</li>
<li>Anomalies page had some anomalies.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.5.2 - 09/03/2005
<ul>
<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1280949&group_id=137197&atid=737990">feature request 1280949</a>:
    Many of DB2's error messages don't give table, column or constraint names but 
    instead give their IDs.  
    As a developer it's a pain to have to try to translate these IDs into something useful.
    SchemaSpy previously gave these details before I converted to the JDBC metadata 
    approach, which doesn't return these IDs.  
    It now displays these IDs for database types that support it and that have the 
    appropriate SQL defined in their properties files.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.5.0 - 08/30/2005
<ul>
<li>Now displays two versions of the main relationships graph: a smaller 'compact' 
    version and a large full-size version.  
    The compact version should make it easier to get a 'big picture' view of the 
    relationships.</li>
<li>Now takes advantage of the GraphVis dot 2.6 ability to point to the East/West 
    center of a node if running dot 2.6 or higher.</li>
<li>Figured out a way to have the graph point to the appropriate portion of the 
    main table in the table detail pages.</li>
<li>Introduced a new anomaly: Columns whose default value is the word 'NULL' or 'null',
    but the SQL NULL value may have been intended.</li>
<li>Realized that index sort order relates to the column, not the index.  
    Not sure what I was thinking.</li>
<li>Added some instructions on the format of connectionSpec in the .properties files.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
